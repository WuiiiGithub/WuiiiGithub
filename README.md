# About Me
Hi Cutieee people,

I’m @WuiiiGithub. I hope you are all doing well. I am a curious guys, studying bachelors. I try a lot of topics in various domains. I post here things which I find interesting and difficult to access. The world progressed a lot through Open Source. And whenever I find few things difficult to access because they are not open source. I love to put my work which I learned it through hard way and put it on open to the world. I love helping people in this manner. 
## My Interests
I’m interested in the following areas:
- Quantum Computing
- Mathematics
- Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Quantum Machine Learning
- Cryptography
- Steganography
- Quantum Cryptography
- Cyber Security
- Discord Bot Development

However, in comming future I am going to develop more at these topics. I am going to more focus on Data Science, ML, QML, Math, QC and Discord Bot development. If I have still plenty of time left I would put that into exploring others too. Meanwhile, till now I have worked on Django, HTML, CSS but I didn't inform because they are not the part of my domain. 
## Further Contacts
You can reach me on few places as I use less social media.
### Discord
Here if you are looking for bot development and using our bots(basic) you can contact me on  ShadowLabs (`https://discord.gg/MAUXDGJxGe`) discord server. If you need to contact more privately then you can reach me out in dms in discord. My userid is `1144930076144697375` and username is `moonlit_shadows` as of now.
### Others
There are other accounts not totally like social media accounts but too private. So have not decided to keep it here. I will update about it if I decide to keep it public.
## Conclusion
Currently, I’m looking to collaborate on some quantum projects to enhance my knowledge about it. Finally, I am happy that you all have read this. Thanks for that and all your support.

Thank you
